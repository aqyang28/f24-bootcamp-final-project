üìÜ My app is titled "Booking101", and it is specifically designed for booking photography services. As a photographer myself, the biggest challenges I face are scheduling and finding clients. The search process for both the client and photographer can be a bit awkward and tedious, but this app works to bundle the whole booking process into a single app, making it much more convenient for both sides. 

üíª To begin, existing users can log in and new users can create a new profile. Upon signing in successfully, users can browse detailed photographer profiles that hold information like a portfolio, list of shoots/styles they specialize in, pricing details, and location. After the user finds a photographer fit for their needs, the user will be prompted to schedule a date and time for a photoshoot. 

üì± I built the iOS application in Xcode and my brother helped me create a Python API that matched my use case. I made Figma to aid in designing the interface of my screens. I took images from Google, my personal portfolio, and SF Symbols. To further my knowledge, I used Apple's Official Swift Developer tutorials, watched Swiftful Thinking on Youtube, and prompted 

üéñÔ∏è Although there are several existing applications that let users schedule services, mine is specifically targeted to those involved in the photography industry. Some people struggle to find a photographer who takes pictures with that aligns with their vision. By allowing users to browse the profiles of photographers, it gives potential clients a better idea of who they're booking with. Ultimately, this app will make the search process for clients and photographers easier and reduce the number of photoshoots where clients walk away unhappy with the results. 

üò£ This was my first time working with APIs on my own and it was pretty difficult trying to understand everything. I'm not too comfortable with decoding JSON so I needed to watch a lot of videos to familiarize myself some more. In the future, I hope to make refine my screens and implement functionality to every button. For the For my login screen, I want to learn how to add a "Forgot my password" option, so that users don't get locked out. Once a user logs in, I want the app to be specific to their profile (i.e. their bookings page and profile page will be personalized and save their information). I also want to add accessibility features to make using my app a smooth experience for everyone. 

üì∏ Overall, I learned a lot from this project process and am excited to continue building the app in the future! üì∏
